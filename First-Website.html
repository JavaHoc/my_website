      <p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. 
         Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown.
         The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots,
         which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. 
         The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. 
         Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. 
         The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.
